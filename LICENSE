GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) [year]  [your name or organization]
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                       Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license
 for software and other kinds of works.  The license is intended
 to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a
 program, to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
 get it if you want it, that you can change the software and share
 your changes with others, and that you are not forced to accept
 a particular proprietary software license.

                       Terms of Use

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or with modifications.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
 that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give
 any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with
 the Program.

  2. You may change the copies of the Program into another medium, 
 or modify it and distribute it under the same terms as above, provided
 that you include your changes in the distribution and state that
 the work is based on the Program.

  3. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  You are not allowed
 to sublicense the Program.

  4. If you distribute the Program in a non-source form, you must
 include a copy of the corresponding source code or make it available.

  5. If you modify the Program and distribute it, you must include
 the modified version of the GPL license and state that it has been
 modified.

  6. This License does not permit incorporating your program into
 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,
 you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
 applications with the library.  But this is not required.

  7. The program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 GNU General Public License for more details.

  8. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
