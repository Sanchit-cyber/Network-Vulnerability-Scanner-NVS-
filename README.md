# Network-Vulnerability-Scanner-NVS-
Overview
The Network Vulnerability Scanner (NVS) is a Python-based tool designed to scan networks for open ports, detect running services, and identify potential vulnerabilities based on known CVEs. This project aims to enhance network security by helping administrators detect and mitigate security risks proactively.
Features
Port Scanning: Scans specified IP addresses and ranges for open ports.
Service Detection: Identifies running services and their versions on open ports.
Vulnerability Detection: Cross-references services with known vulnerabilities from the CVE database.
Report Generation: Generates a detailed report of detected vulnerabilities in PDF format.
Network Mapping: Maps the network topology and identifies all connected devices.
Automated Remediation Suggestions: Provides recommendations to fix vulnerabilities.

## Acknowledgments

This project utilizes several open-source tools and libraries:

- **Nmap**: A powerful network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a network. [Nmap Website](https://nmap.org/)
- **Scapy**: A Python library for packet manipulation and crafting. [Scapy Documentation](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- **vFeed**: A framework for managing vulnerabilities and CVEs, utilized for vulnerability lookups. [vFeed GitHub](https://github.com/cyb3rj3ff/vFeed)
- **CVE API**: Provides access to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database for vulnerability information.
- **FPDF**: A Python library for generating PDF documents. [FPDF Documentation](http://www.fpdf.org/)

These tools were instrumental in developing the Network Vulnerability Scanner (NVS) and have significantly enhanced its capabilities. Please refer to their respective documentation for more information on their usage and licensing.


Technologies Used:-
> Python
> Nmap (for network scanning)
> Scapy (for packet manipulation)
> vFeed or CVE API (for vulnerability lookup)
> FPDF (for PDF report generation)
Prerequisites:
Before running the tool, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
Python 3.x
Nmap (you can install it via sudo apt-get install nmap or download from nmap.org)
Required Python libraries:
pip install scapy python-nmap fpdf
Installation:-
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Sanchit-cyber/Network-Vulnerability-Scanner-NVS-.git
cd Network-Vulnerability-Scanner-NVS-
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the tool:
python main.py
Usage:
To scan a network and generate a report:
Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command:
python main.py --target 192.168.1.1/24
Replace 192.168.1.1/24 with the target IP or range of IPs you wish to scan.
Command Line Options:
--target: Specify the IP or IP range to scan.
--output: Specify the output file for the report (optional).
Example:
python main.py --target 192.168.1.1/24 --output report.pdf
Output:-
The tool generates a detailed report of open ports, detected services, and potential vulnerabilities. The report includes:
A list of open ports
Identified services and versions
Matched CVEs for detected services
Remediation recommendations for each vulnerability
